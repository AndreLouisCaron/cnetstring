  ``cnetstring``: Streaming netstring parser for C

Description
===========

This library provides a parser for `netstrings`_.  The parser is implemented as
a finite state machine (FSM) for use in streaming applications (i.e. data
arrives at an unpredictable rate and the parser must be interruptible).  As
such, the parser itself does not buffer any received data.  It just forwards it
to registered callbacks.  It requires little overhead and is well suited for
being used in an object-oriented wrapper.


Known uses
==========

The parser is used in the `cscgi`_ project to parse the `SCGI`_ request headers.

Getting started
===============

The library is currently only distributed in source form.  However, it has no
dependencies on external projects and will compile as-is with almost any C
compiler.

The following presents the *supported* way to get up and running with
``cnetstring``.  Feel free to experiment with your toolchain of choice.

Requirements
------------

Dependencies are:

#. Git_
#. CMake_
#. Doxygen_
#. A C++ compiler toolchain:

   * Microsoft Visual Studio
   * ``g++`` and ``make``

.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/
.. _CMake: http://www.cmake.org/
.. _Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

Standalone build
----------------

#. Get the source code.

   ::

      > git clone git://github.com/AndreLouisCaron/cnetstring.git
      > cd cnetstring

   Feel free to check out a specific version

   ::

      > git tag
      v0.1

      > git checkout v0.1

#. Generate the build scripts.

   ::

      > mkdir work
      > cd work
      > cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..

   The following CMake options are supported:

   #. ``CNETSTRING_BUILD_CXX``: build C++ targets.
   #. ``CNETSTRING_BUILD_DEMOS``: build demo programs.
   #. ``CNETSTRING_BUILD_TESTS``: build test programs.

   All options are set to ``ON`` by default in the standalone builds.  Options
   for demos and tests are ignored and forced to ``OFF`` when build as a
   dependency.

   To change these settings, use the CMake ``-D`` command line option.  For
   example, to skip compilation of the demo programs, use this command:

   ::

      > cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DCNETSTRING_BUILD_DEMOS=OFF

#. Build the source code.

   ::

      > nmake

#. Run the test suite.

   ::

      > nmake /A test

   If the ``CNETSTRING_BUILD_TESTS`` option was set to ``OFF``, this will not
   run any tests.

#. Build the API documentation.

   ::

      > nmake help

   Open the HTML documentation in ``help/html/index.html``.

   If Doxygen is not available, this target is not registered so you cannot
   build the documentation.

Embedded build
--------------

#. Register as a Git sub-module.

   ::

      > cd myproject
      > git submodule add git://github.com/AndreLouisCaron/cnetstring.git libs/cnetstring

   Feel free to check out a specific version.

   ::

      > cd libs/cnetstring
      > git tag
      v0.1

      > git checkout v0.1
      > cd ../..
      > git add libs/cnetstring

#. Add ``cnetstring`` targets to your CMake project.

   ::

      set(cnetstring_DIR
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/cnetstring
      )

#. Make sure your CMake project can ``#include <netstring.h>``.

   ::

      include_directories(
        ${cnetstring_include_dirs}
      )


#. Link against the ``netstring`` library.

   ::

      target_link_libraries(my-application ${cnetstring_libraries})
